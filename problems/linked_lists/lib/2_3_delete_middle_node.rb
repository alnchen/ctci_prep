require_relative '../linked_list'

=begin
implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e. any node but
the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a single
linked list, given only access to that node

example:
input: the node c from the linked list a->b->c->d->e->f
result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e->f
