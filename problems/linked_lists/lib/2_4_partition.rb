=begin
write code to partition a linked list around the value x such that all
nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. if x
is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the
elements less than x (see below). the partition element x can appear
anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the
left and right partitions.

example:
input: 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 (partition = 5)
output: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8
